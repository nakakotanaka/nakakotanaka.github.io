### Welcome to Kota's Personal Website!

I’m a Ph.D. student at Iowa State University in Interdepartmental Microbiology Program. I am passionate about virology, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. 

I hold a B.S. in Clinical Plant Science from Hosei University in Japan and an M.S. in Plant Biology from Michigan State University (MSU), where focused on research in plant virology. After my M.S., I worked in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory at MSU, where I focused on molecular diagnostics of animal diseases and applied bioinformatics to develop diagnostic workflows and conduct epidemiological studies.

My long-term goal is to advance plant health by improving management and monitoring strategies and by deepening our understanding of virus–vector–plant interactions. I’m excited to expand my expertise in molecular biology and bioengineering to conduct translational research that strengthens plant health at ISU!
