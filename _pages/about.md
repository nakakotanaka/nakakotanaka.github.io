### Welcome to my website!

I am currently a laboratory technologist at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University. \
My passion lies in research and diagnostics in plant and animal health sciences, with a particular focus on virology. My experience encompasses plant viral disease diagnostics, virome analysis, phylogenetic studies, and the development of bioinformatics pipelines. \
I aspire to integarte cutting-edge technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, to address critical biological questions and develop solutions for challenges in plant and animal health.
