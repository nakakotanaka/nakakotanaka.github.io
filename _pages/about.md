### Welcome to my website!

I am currently a laboratory technologist at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University. 

My passion lies in research and diagnostics in plant and animal health sciences, with a particular focus on virology. My experience encompasses plant viral disease diagnostics, virome analysis, phylogenetic studies, and the development of bioinformatics pipelines. 
Through my research, I aspire to to develop solutions for challenges in plant and animal health by
integrating advanced tools, such as high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics.
