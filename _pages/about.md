### Welcome to my website!

I’m Kota, a biologist with a strong interest in virology, bioinformatics, and molecular diagnostics. I currently work in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory, where I focus on molecular diagnostics of animal diseases and apply bioinformatics to support both diagnostic workflows and epidemiological studies.

I hold a B.S. in Clinical Plant Science from Hosei University and an M.S. in Plant Biology from Michigan State University, where I specialized in plant virology. Beginning this summer, I will start my Ph.D. in the Interdepartmental Microbiology Program at Iowa State University.

My long-term goal is to improve disease diagnostics and management strategies in agriculture. My experience includes viral and cancer diagnostics, virome characterization, and phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. At Iowa State, I’m excited to expand my expertise in molecular biology and bioengineering, with a focus on translating research into practical solutions for plant health!
